In order to update  Enigma.D3.Core and Enigma.D3.Assets we need a minidump of a D3 process. The game
needs to be fully initialized, getting to the login screen is enough. The minidump needs to be located
at "%TEMP%\Diablo III.DMP".

To create a dump using Task Manager:
	Open the "Windows Task Manager"
	Select the "Processes" tab
	Right click the process you wish to take a dump of
	Select "Create Dump File

NB: If you create multiple minidumps, a number will be appended to the file name "Diablo III (2).DMP"
    and so on. The code generator uses the first file, "Diablo III.DMP". Keep in mind these files are
	large (>1.3GB) so you might want to delete it afterwards (Windows will delete it eventually).


Now you can run the following to update both Core and Assets. You can also do one at a time. The
-deploy switch can be omitted if you don't want it to overwrite the solution files.
