# D3Helper-Reks-MageMod

I take no credit for any of this source.  I simply downloaded 2 projects that were publicly available, updated them and added some new functionality.

D3Helper Souce came from here: https://d3helper.freeforums.net/post/2208/thread

Enigma Libraries Source came from here: https://github.com/Enigma32/Enigma.D3/tree/legacy

The Enigma Lirbraries legacy tree was not yet updated with the latest memory offsets so I did that myself by copying the latest offsets from the master branch here: https://github.com/Enigma32/Enigma.D3

Then I updated the D3helper source with the offsets and got the project building and working with the latest D3 patch.

After that, I added new functionality to support Player_Pet_MinSkeletalMageCount and Player_Pet_MaxSkeletalMageCount.
